## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This program calculates the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere
from a set of randomly generated radius values. The program asks for the number
of values to generate, and creates three output files containing the radii 
("radii.out"), areas ("areas.out") and volumes ("volumes.out") respectively.

## PROGRAM USAGE

1. Compile the program "exercise3.exe" by running `make`
2. Run the program by doing `./exercise3.exe`
3. You may find the output of the last execution in the output `.out` files
4. Remove everything but the original code using `make clean`
